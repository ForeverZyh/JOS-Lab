1. In the marcos TRAPHANDLER and TRAPHANDLER_NOEC, a function depends on 'name'
is defined. And if two of the function's names are the same, these two functions
have to link to the same address. So the consequences of calling these two
functions are the same as well. That's why we can't pass identical interrupt/
exception id to handler, and the kernel doesn't know which interrupt or
exception is.

2. Because the privilege level of Page Fault is 0, and user can't directly call
the 'int $0xe'.
